Linear regression with multiple variables to predict the prices of houses.
Suppose you are selling your house and you want to know what a go o d market 
price would be. One way to do this is to first collect information on 
recent houses sold and make a model of housing prices.
The file ex1data2.txt contains a training set of housing prices in Portland, Oregon.
The first column is the size of the house (in square feet), the
second column is the number of bedrooms, and the third column is the price
of the house.
